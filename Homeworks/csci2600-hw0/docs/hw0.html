    <h2 class="western"><a name="getting_started"></a>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>In what follows, we assume that you have Eclipse and Git properly
      installed, and you have checked out project csci2600-hw0. If you
      encountered problems, please contact the TAs or the instructors
      immediately.</p>
    <p>Throughout the course you will receive starter code and submit
      your assignments through Git. Git is a version control system that
      allows software engineers to backup, manage, and collaborate on
      large software projects. </p>

      Throughout this homework we explain Git commands, Eclipse, and
      JUnit in context.</p>
    <h2 class="western"><a name="Problem1"></a><!-- ************************PROBLEM 1****************************** -->Problem
1:



      Your first Java class — RandomHello</h2>
    <p>Create your Java class with a <tt class="western">main</tt>
      method that will randomly choose and then print to the console one
      of five possible greetings that you define.</p>
    <p>Create the file <tt class="western">RandomHello.java</tt>, which
      will define a Java class named <tt class="western">RandomHello</tt>
      that will reside in the Java package <tt class="western">hw0</tt>.
      (Assuming your repository is checked into <code>csci-2600/hw0</code>,
      the file name would be <tt class="western"><em>csci-2600/hw0</em></tt><tt
        class="western">/src/main/java/hw0/RandomHello.java</tt>.) To
      create a new Java class file, go to Package Explorer and select
      package <tt class="western">hw0</tt> under the <tt
        class="western">src/main/java</tt>, then select <b>File -&gt;
        New -&gt; Class</b>. Specify the enclosing package <tt
        class="western">hw0</tt> and name <tt class="western">RandomHello</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>Java requires every runnable class to contain a <tt
        class="western">main</tt> method whose signature is <tt
        class="western">public static void main(String[] args)</tt>. A
      code skeleton for the <tt class="western">RandomHello</tt> class
      is shown below. Eclipse will generate some of this skeleton for
      you when you create the new <tt class="western">RandomHello</tt>
      class. Add a public method called getGreeting() as shown below.</p>
    <p><tt class="western">RandomHello.java</tt>:</p>
    <pre class="western">package hw0;

/**
 * RandomHello selects a random greeting to display to the user.
 */
public class RandomHello {

    /**
     * Uses a RandomHello object to print
     * a random greeting to the console.
     */
    public static void main(String[] argv) {
        RandomHello randomHello = new RandomHello();
        System.out.println(randomHello.getGreeting());
    }

    /**
     * @return a random greeting from a list of five different greetings.
     */
    public String getGreeting() {
        // YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    }
}</pre>
    <p> This skeleton is meant only to serve as a starting point; you
      are free to organize it as you see fit. </p>
    <h3 class="western"><a name="wheel-reinvention"></a>No Need to
      Reinvent the Wheel</h3>
    <p>Don't write your own random number generator to decide which
      greeting to select. Instead, take advantage of Java's <a
        href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html">Random</a>
      class. (This is a good example of the adage "Know and Use the
      Libraries" as described in Chapter 7 of Joshua Bloch's <i>Effective



        Java</i>. Learning the libraries will take some time, but it's
      worth it!)</p>
    <p>Type the following into the body of your <tt class="western">getGreeting()</tt>
      method: </p>
    <pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Random randomGenerator = new Random();</pre>
    <p> This line creates a random number generator. (Not a <i>random
        number</i>, which comes later, but a Java object that can <i>generate</i>
      random numbers. In Eclipse, your code may be marked as an error by
      a red underline. This is because the <tt class="western">Random</tt>
      class is defined in a package that has not yet been imported (<tt
        class="western">java.lang</tt> and <tt class="western">hw0</tt>
      are the only packages that are implicitly imported). Java
      libraries are organized as packages and you can only access Java
      classes in packages that are imported. To import <tt
        class="western">java.util.Random</tt>, add the following line
      under the line <tt class="western">package hw0;</tt> at the top
      of your file (after the <tt class="western">package hw0;</tt>
      declaration):</p>
    <pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">import java.util.Random;</pre>
    <p> This will import the class <a
        href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html">Random</a>
      into your file. To automatically add all necessary imports and
      remove unused imports, Eclipse lets you type <b>CTRL-SHIFT-O</b>
      to <i><b>O</b></i><i>rganize</i> your imports. Because there is
      only one class named <tt class="western">Random</tt>, Eclipse
      will figure out that you mean to import <tt class="western">java.util.Random</tt>
      and will add the above line of code automatically. (If the name of
      the class that needs to be imported is ambiguous — for example,
      there is a <font color="#000000"><span style="text-decoration:
          none"><a
            href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html">java.util.List</a>
        </span></font>as well as a <a
        href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/List.html">java.awt.List</a>
      — then Eclipse will prompt you to choose the one to import.) </p>
    <h3 class="western"><a name="using-random"></a>Using
      java.util.Random</h3>
    <p>Read the documentation for <tt class="western">Random</tt>'s <tt
        class="western">nextInt(int n)</tt> method by going to the <a
        href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/">Java API</a>
      and selecting <tt class="western">Random</tt> from the list of
      classes in the left-hand frame. Many classes also allow you to
      pull up documentation directly in Eclipse. Just hover over the
      class or method name and press SHIFT+F2. </p>
    <p>Use the <tt class="western">nextInt(int n)</tt> method to choose
      your greeting. You don't have to understand all the details of its
      behavior specification, only that it returns a random number from
      0 to n-1. </p>
    <p>One way to choose a random greeting is using an array. This
      approach might look something like: </p>
    <pre class="western">String[] greetings = new String[5];
greetings[0] = "Hello, World";
greetings[1] = "Hola Mundo";
greetings[2] = "Bonjour, le Monde";
greetings[3] = "Hallo Welt";
greetings[4] = "Ciao Mondo";</pre>
    <p> The <tt class="western">main</tt> method in the skeleton code
      above prints the value returned by <tt class="western">getGreeting</tt>.
      So if you insert code in <tt class="western">getGreeting</tt> to
      select a greeting randomly, when the class is run it will print
      that greeting. </p>
    <p>When you are finished writing your code and it compiles, run it
      several times to ensure that all five greetings can be displayed.
      (To run select <b>Run -&gt; Run</b> from the main menu, or
      right-click on <tt class="western">RandomHello.java</tt> in
      Package Explorer, then select <b>Run As -&gt; Java Application</b>.)


    </p>
    <p>Next, add your new file to version control, commit it into your
      local repository, and push to the repository on the server. Follow
      the <a
href="https://www.cs.rpi.edu/%7Ethompw4/CSCI-2600/Spring2019/Documents/eclipse_and_git.pdf">Setup</a>
      handout for the relevant Git commands. </p>
    <p>For Problems 2-4, <b>DO NOT</b> edit files with test cases
      (FibonacciTest.java, BallTest.java, BallContainerTest.java, and
      BoxTest.java). If you do, you can make all your test cases run
      successfully on your local machine. However, when you submit your
      assignment to Submitty, we will be using our own original copies
      of all test cases, not the ones you might have committed to your
      repository, for autograding. It might lead to your code failing
      some or all of the test cases on Submitty despite the fact that
      the entire test suite ran successfully on your local machine. </p>

      Testing Java Code with JUnit</h2>
    <p><!-- <div style="float:right; margin-left:10px;"><img src="junit_failure.png" alt="Screenshot: Run Junit from Eclipse" /></div>-->Part
of



      your job as a software engineer is to verify that the software you
      produce works according to its specification. One form of
      verification is testing. <a href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a> is
      a framework for creating <em>unit</em> tests in Java. A unit test
      is a test for verifying that a given method in a class conforms to
      its specification. In this problem, we will provide you with a
      quick overview and simple example of how JUnit works. (Later
      homeworks will look more deeply into unit testing.) </p>
    <p>Open both <tt class="western">src/main/java/hw0/Fibonacci.java</tt>
      and <tt class="western">src/test/java/hw0/FibonacciTest.java</tt>.
      From the comments, you can see that <tt class="western">FibonacciTest</tt>
      is a test of the <tt class="western">Fibonacci</tt> class. </p>
    <p>Now run <tt class="western">FibonacciTest</tt>. (Right-click on
      <tt class="western">FibonacciTest.java</tt>, then select <b>Run
        As -&gt; JUnit test</b>.) If you don’t see <b>Run As -&gt;
        JUnit test </b><span style="font-weight: normal">when you
        right-click, right-click on the project name in the Package
        Explorer and select </span><b>Properties</b><span
        style="font-weight: normal">. Select </span><b>Java Build Path</b><span
        style="font-weight: normal">, and click the </span><b>Add
        Library</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">button. Select </span><b>Junit</b>
      <span style="font-weight: normal">and click </span><b>Next</b><span
        style="font-weight: normal">. Select </span><b>Junit 4 </b><span
        style="font-weight: normal">(not Junit 5) and click </span><b>Finish</b><span
        style="font-weight: normal">. Click the </span><b>Apply and
        Close</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">button.</span></p>
    <p>A window or panel with a menacing red bar will appear, indicating
      that some of the tests in <tt class="western">FibonacciTest</tt>
      did not complete successfully. The top pane displays the list of
      tests that failed, while the bottom pane shows the Failure Trace
      for the highlighted test. The first line in the Failure Trace
      should display an error message that explains why the test failed
      (it is the responsibility of the author of the test code to
      produce this error message).</p>
    <p>If you click on the failure <tt class="western">testThrowsIllegalArgumentException()</tt>,
      the bottom pane will switch to the appropriate error message. In
      this example, the first line of the failure trace shows that <tt
        class="western">Fibonacci.java</tt> improperly threw an <tt
        class="western">IllegalArgumentException</tt> when tested with
      zero (0) as its argument. (You may have to scroll the pane to the
      right to see this). If you double-click on the name of a test in
      the top pane, Eclipse will jump to the line where the failure
      occurred in the editor pane. Figure out the problem in <tt
        class="western">Fibonacci.java</tt>, fix it, and rerun the JUnit
      test. Eclipse will automatically rebuild when you make changes. </p>
    <p>Use the information in the Failure Trace box to help you continue
      debugging <tt class="western">Fibonacci</tt>. Keep a record of
      what you did to debug <tt class="western">Fibonacci</tt> as you
      will have to answer questions about your debugging experience in
      the next problem. After you have fixed all the problems in <tt
        class="western">Fibonacci</tt>, you should see a bright green
      bar instead of a red one when you run <tt class="western">FibonacciTest</tt>.
    </p>
    <h2 class="western"><a name="Problem3"></a><!-- TODO: Figure out what to do with this!
<p> Now look at
the JUnit tests that we wrote for <tt>HolaWorld</tt> and
<tt>RandomHello</tt> in <a href="#Problem5">Problem 5</a> earlier. They are called
<tt>HolaWorldTest</tt> and <tt>RandomHelloTest</tt>,

      Getting a Real Taste of Java — Balls and Boxes</h2>
    <p>Until now, we have only been introducing tools. In this problem,
      we will delve into a real programming exercise. If you are not
      familiar with Java, we recommend working through the Oracle's <a
        href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html">Learning
the



        Java Language tutorial</a>. (Skip the section on generics for
      now.) Fragments of Oracle's <a
        href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/">other tutorials</a>
      may also be useful, specifically "Getting Started", "Essential
      Java Classes", and "Collections". </p>
    <p>This problem is intended to give you a better sense of what Java
      programming entails. This problem can be somewhat challenging.
      Don't be discouraged, we're here to help. And we expect that time
      spent now will pay off significantly during the rest of the
      course. </p>
    <p>As you work on this problem, record your answers to the various
      questions in <tt class="western">problem4.txt</tt> in the
      project's <tt class="western">answers</tt> folder.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><b>Warm-Up: Creating a Ball</b>: </p>
        <p>Take a look at <tt class="western">src/main/java/hw0/Ball.java</tt>.
          A <tt class="western">Ball</tt> is a simple object that has
          the volume and the color.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>What is wrong with <tt class="western">Ball.java</tt>?
              Please fix the problems with <tt class="western">Ball.java</tt>
              and document your work in <tt class="western">problem4.txt</tt>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We have included a JUnit test called <tt class="western">src/test/java/hw0/BallTest.java</tt>
          to help you out. In Eclipse, one of its warnings should help
          you find at least one of the bugs without referring to the
          JUnit results.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Using Pre-Defined Data Structures</b>: </p>
        <p>Next, we want to create a class called <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>.
          As before, skeleton code is provided (see <tt class="western">BallContainer.java</tt>).




          A BallContainer is a container for Balls. BallContainer must
          support the following methods and your task is to fill in the
          code that will implement all these methods correctly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">add(Ball)</tt>

          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">getVolume()</tt>
            </p>
          </li>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">size()</tt>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">differentColors()</tt>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">areSameColor()</tt>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">clear()</tt>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>

            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The specifications for these methods are found in the code of
          <tt class="western">BallContainer.java</tt>. </p>
        <p>In BallContainer, we use a <a
            href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Set.html">java.util.Set</a>
          to keep track of the balls. This is a great example of using a
          predefined Java data structure to save yourself significant
          work. </p>
        <p>Before implementing each method, read the documentation for <tt
            class="western">Set</tt>. Some of your methods will be as
          simple as calling the appropriate predefined methods for the <a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Set.html">Set</a>.
          To help you out, we included a JUnit test called <tt
            class="western">src/test/java/hw0/BallContainerTest.java</tt>.</p>
        <p>Before you start coding, please take time to think about the
          following question (which you need to answer in the text
          file):</p>

        <p><b>Implementing a Box</b>: </p>
        <p>In this problem, you will do a little more design and
          thinking and a little less coding. You will implement the <tt
            class="western">Box</tt> class. A Box is also a container
          for Balls. The key difference between a <tt class="western">Box</tt>
          and a <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt> is that a Box
          has only finite volume. Once a box is full, we cannot put in
          more Balls. The size (volume) of a Box is defined when the
          constructor is called:</p>
        <pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">public Box(double volume);</pre>
        <p> Since a <tt class="western">Box</tt> is in many ways
          similar to a <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>, we
          internally keep track of many things in the <tt
            class="western">Box</tt> with a <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>,
          allowing us to reuse code. Many of the methods in <tt
            class="western">Box</tt> can simply "delegate" to the
          equivalent in <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>; for
          example, removing from a <tt class="western">Box</tt> cannot
          cause it to exceed its volume limit. This design of having one
          class contain an object of another class and reusing many of
          the latter class's methods is called <b>composition</b>. </p>
        <p>(<b>Optional Note</b>: If you are familiar with Java, you may
          wonder why we did not simply make <tt class="western">Box</tt>
          extend <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt> via
          "inheritance"; that is, why did we not make <tt
            class="western">Box</tt> a subclass of <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>.
          We will discuss this much more deeply later in the course, but
          the key idea is that <tt class="western">Box</tt> is not what
          we call a true subtype of <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>
          because it is in fact more limited than <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>
          (a <tt class="western">Box</tt> can only hold a limited
          amount); hence, a user who uses a <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>
          in their code can not simply substitute that <tt
            class="western">BallContainer</tt> with a <tt
            class="western">Box</tt> and assume the same behavior in the
          program. (The code may cause the Box to fill up, but they did
          not have this concern when using a <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>).




          For this reason, it is not a good idea to make <tt
            class="western">Box</tt> extend <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>.)



        </p>
        <p>In addition to the constructor described above, you will need
          to implement the following new methods in <tt class="western">Box</tt>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><tt class="western">add(Ball)</tt>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><tt class="western">getBallsFromSmallest()</tt> </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The specifications for these methods can be found in the code
          of <tt class="western">Box</tt>. </p>
        <p>A few things to consider before you start writing code: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">You should not implement your
              own sorting algorithm. Instead, take advantage of the Java
              API (remember, "Know and Use the Libraries"). </p>

          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Also, you shouldn't need to
              change your implementation of <tt class="western">BallContainer</tt>
              or <tt class="western">Ball</tt> for this problem. In
              particular, you should not implement the <tt

      Turning In Your Homework</h2>
    <p>Each homework will indicate exactly what you need to turn in a
      Section entitled <b>What to Turn In</b> (see below).</p>
    <p><!-- <p>If you add a new file, you must explicitly add it to your SVN
repository. This means that you need to tell SVN to "track this file"
as part of the repository. In addition, you need
to <b><a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~milanova/csci2600/EditingCompilingWithEclipse.html#Commit">commit</a></b>
the file to actually put the contents in the repository. Make sure
that, when you're done, your working copy is committed to the
repository so that we get and grade your most up-to-date version.
</p>

<p>Since files like <tt>RandomHello.java</tt>, <tt>problem3.txt</tt>
and <tt>problem4.txt</tt> are not in your SVN repository, you must add
them. You also want to commit the changes you made to
<tt>Fibonacci.java</tt>, <tt>Ball.java</tt>,
<tt>BallContainer.java</tt>, and <tt>Box.java</tt>. </p>
-->Make sure that you have added all new files to version control (e.g.,
      <tt class="western">RandomHello.java</tt>, <tt class="western">answers/problem3.txt</tt>,
      and <tt class="western">answers/problem4.txt</tt>). In Eclipse,
      right-click on project <tt class="western">csci2600-hw0</tt>,
      then select <b>Team -&gt; Commit</b> to commit all changes. Don't
      forget to push into the remote repository on the server:
      right-click on project <tt class="western">csci2600-hw0</tt>,
      then select <b>Team -&gt; Push to Upstream</b>. </p>
    <p>After completing these steps, all your code and materials to turn

    <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Make sure that you have the correct folder
      structure. If you break the structure, compilation on the Submitty

(source code for these problems can be found in the <tt>hw0.optional</tt>

the optional problems will help you become more comfortable with Java.
</p>
--><!-- <h2 id="debugger">Optional Debugger Tutorial</h2>
<p>
In this part, you will learn to Eclipse's built-in debugger. As the name
suggests, a debugger helps you debug your program by allowing you to "watch"
your program as it executes, one line at a time, and inspect the state of
variables along the way.  In the past, you may have
used <tt>System.out.println()</tt> to probe the state of a variable or find out
whether a particular line is reached. In that sense, debuggers are like an
ultra-super-powerful <tt>System.out.println()</tt>.
</p>

<p>One of the most useful features of a debugger is the ability to
set <em>breakpoints</em> in your program. When you run your program through the
debugger, it will pause when it reaches a line with a breakpoint. You can
inspect the current state of variables, then continue running your program
normally or step through one line at a time to watch the variables change.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open Adder.java. This simple program is supposed to print the sum of two
  user-provided integers. Try running it a few times (or reading the source
  code) and you'll see that it doesn't behave as expected.</li>
  <li>Double-click in the left-hand margin of the class next to the
  line <code>return x - y;</code> A blue circle should appear, indicating a
  breakpoint. (Double-clicking again removes the breakpoint.)</li>
  <li>Run the program in debug mode by using F11, <code>Run >> Debug</code>, or
  the green bug icon in the toolbar. As before, enter two ints (say, 3 and 4) in
  the console when prompted. When your program hits the breakpoint, Eclipse asks
  if you want to open the Debug perspective. Choose yes.</li>
  <li>The debug perspective looks overwhelming at first, but don't worry! In the
  top-right panel, select the "Variables" tab and you'll see the names and
  values of all variables in the current context. The top-left panel ("Debug")
  shows where the program is currently paused, where the current method was
  called, and so on. (This is called the stack trace). Double-click on a method
  name to see the corresponding line in the panel below, where you can view and
  edit your source code. Finally, the bottom-left panel shows the console
  window.
  <p><em>What are all the names and values listed in the "Variables" panel? What
  does the "Debug" panel list as the current method and line number? (Write down
  the text that was highlighted when the Debug perspective first
  opened.)</em></p></li>
  <li>Immediately above the "Debug" panel are several buttons for running your
  program. Mouse over each one for a description. "Resume" (green arrow) causes
  your program to continue executing normally until it finishes or hits another
  breakpoint. If you want to monitor what happens shortly after the breakpoint,
  use "Step Into" and "Step Over" (yellow arrows). "Step Over" executes the
  current line and pauses on the next line. "Step Into" enters any method called
  on the current line so you can execute that method line-by-line. (To finish
  the current method and jump back to the caller, use "Step Out.") Hit "Step
  Over" once to execute the <code>return</code> statement and
  exit <code>computeSum</code>. Hit "Step Over" again to progress to the next
  line.
  <p><em>What are all the names and values listed in the "Variables" panel after
